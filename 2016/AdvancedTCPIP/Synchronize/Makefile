# Clear any default targets for building .class files from .java files; we 
# will provide our own target entry to do this in this makefile.
# make has a set of default targets for different suffixes (like .c.o) 
# Currently, clearing the default for .java.class is not necessary since 
# make does not have a definition for this target, but later versions of 
# make may, so it doesn't hurt to make sure that we clear any default 
# definitions for these

.SUFFIXES: .java .class


#
# Here is our target entry for creating .class files from .java files 
# This is a target entry that uses the suffix rule syntax:
#	DSTS:
#		rule
#  'TS' is the suffix of the target file, 'DS' is the suffix of the dependency 
#  file, and 'rule'  is the rule for building a target	
# '$*' is a built-in macro that gets the basename of the current target 
# Remember that there must be a < tab > before the command line ('rule') 
#
.java.class:
	$(JCC) $(JCCFLAGS) $*.java


#
# CLASSES is a macro consisting of 4 words (one for each java source file)
#
CLASSES = \
    Global.java \
	Worker.java \
	Main.java


#
# the default make target entry
#
default: classes


#
# This target entry uses Suffix Replacement within a macro: 
# $(name:string1=string2)
# 	In the words in the macro named 'name' replace 'string1' with 'string2'
# Below we are replacing the suffix .java of all words in the macro CLASSES 
# with the .class suffix
#
classes: $(CLASSES:.java=.class)


#
# RM is a predefined macro in make (RM = rm -f)
#
clean:
	$(RM) *.class

# Main Class
#
MAIN = Main


#
# Next two lines contain a target for running the program
# Remember the tab in the second line.
# $(JMV) y $(MAIN) are replaced by their values
